                    <h3>Brockenhurst</h3>

                    <p>
                        Brockenhurst is a small village in the New Forest about mid-way between the towns of Lyndhurst
                        and Lymington
                        (and located on the main road between them).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a truly lovely place, although very small, but the attraction is not the village so much
                        as it being
                        surrounded on all sides by the new forest. There is open forest dense with trees and paths
                        through them
                        (maintained pebble-covered paths as well as paths more correctly labelled "tracks") in some
                        directions, and
                        miles of moorland with spares growth and lots of grass in others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can walk any one of dozens of routes in a circle and end up back at the village and there
                        are routes of
                        many times and near-infinite lengths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not only possible but quite easy and very pleasant to walk to Lyndhurst through the forest
                        by any of
                        multiple routes. You can walk through the forest on one side of the main road, and then walk
                        back through a
                        completely different forest on the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are two campsites just outside the village, one a smaller affair and one exteremely large
                        one



                        called Hollands Wood which is a "Camping In The Forest" campsite - a joint venture between and
                        Camping and
                        Caravanning Club and the Forestry Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hollands Wood is <em>in</em> the open forest, meaning trees are everywhere, and so are the New
                        Forest
                        Ponies! There is no barrier around the campsite, it is litterally just in the forest, so the
                        ponies come and
                        go as they please. The site is massive and does not have marked pitches, you just pitch wherever
                        you want
                        (within certain rules). It can accomodate over 600 units.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Much as the ponies can wander around the campsite, they are also free to wander around the
                        village. It is
                        not uncommon to see them on the high street (see photos). The judicious use of cattle grids
                        keeps them from
                        certain areas - people's private property and the main road - but other than this is their turf
                        and humans
                        are just guests there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall there's nowehere really like this place. Well, other villages in the New Forest I guess,
                        but I think
                        I meant the forest. It's truly beautiful, you could explore it for the rest of you life and
                        never run out of
                        new discoveries, the paths are very well maintained and are pleasure to walk onn, and it's
                        really easy to
                        camp there. Basically, it's Walker Nirvana.

                    <h3>Swanage, Dorset</h3>
                    <p>
                        Swanage is a lovely town on the coast of Dorset. It is a fairly typical English seaside town
                        with a relaxed
                        atmosphere, lots of places to eat and a truly lovely beach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The beach is very sandy and very long, but there are also many and frequent groynes which makes
                        me favourite
                        activity of beach-walking difficult. There is no amusement pier but there is an old
                        Victorian-era pier that
                        you can visit for a £1 entry fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My love of Swanage is more for its location that the place itself, although it is a lovely town.
                        Within easy
                        reach are Corfe Castle, Poole Harbour and Bournemouth, as well as a plethora of walking
                        possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is no (modern) train to Swanage, but Wareham is on a the main line from London Waterloo
                        and you can
                        then get a bus direct to Swanage, or you can get off that bus at Corfe Castle, see the castle,
                        and then get
                        a steam train to Swanage for a modest fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's also possible to walk from Wareham to Swanage which I did on my first trip, part of the
                        Purbeck Way
                        joins the two. I walked six miles the first day (a late start due to getting the train from
                        Essex) from
                        Wareham to <a href="https://nordenfarm.com/">Norden Farm campsite</a>, a very pleasant campsite
                        on a working
                        farm just outside Corfe Castle. Then on the second day I walked about the same distance to
                        Swanage. The leg
                        involves quite a lot of climbing up some rather large hills, but the view from the top is more
                        than worth
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There appear to be quite a few campsites in the area, but so far I've only stayed at <a
                            href="https://www.ulwellholidaypark.co.uk/">Ulwell Holiday Park</a>. This place is about a
                        mile outside of
                        Swanage proper and you can either get the bus to Swanage, walk the same route the bus would
                        alt="something"> take in about half an hour (or a bit less) or you can
                        get most of the way there via public rights of way through the countryside - one of which
                        literally starts
                        at the fence of the holiday park.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The park is a mixture of static holiday homes and pitches for tents and caravans/motorhomes. One
                        of the
                        primary benefits for me is that they have a small area for very small hiking tents that has only
                        four
                        pitches but costs from £10-£13. And that includes use of all the facilities, including the pool
                        if you like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I <em>love</em>the buses in this area. They have screens on them telling you what the next stop
                        is, as well
                        as audio annoucements of the same, sometimes. For a partially sighted person who can't always
                        tell what he's
                        looking at out of the window, this is a godsend. There's a bus stop just outside Ulwell Holiday
                        Park which
                        will get you to Swanage in about five minutes in one direction or Bournemouth and Poole (with
                        one transfer)
                        in the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bus towards Bournemouth crosses the mouth to Poole Harbour on a ferry which, let's be
                        honest, is pretty
                        cool. And then just the other side of the harbour entrance you have Sandbanks, which has one of
                        the sandiest
                        most beautiful beaches I've ever seen, and Bournemouth or Poole about half an hour away by bus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before you pass across the harbour entrance through, you pass through Studland, probably my
                        favourite place
                        in the region. First of all a large potion of it is a nature reserve and therefore very
                        beautiful, but also
                        Studland beach offers about three miles of uninterupted beach-walking along it which I found
                        highly
                        enjoyable (if a bit odd at one point - the middle of Studland beach is a nudist beach, which I
                        had not known
                        prior to my walk).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, for anyone who just likes being outdoors in a variety of environments, Swanage and the
                        surrounding
                        area will have you covered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cromer is a lovely seaside town on the north-Norfolk coast. Like Swanage, it's fairly standard
                        for and
                        English beach town and a very pleasant place to spend some time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've stayed rwice at the Caravanning and Motorhome Club campsite which is just outside Cromer (I
                        think the
                        adress is technically East Runton, though it's about halfway between the two on the main road to
                        Sheringham). The site is lovely as and very neat, as expected from on of the big clubs. And
                        despite being
                        the Caravan and Motorhome Club has a tent field with about ten pitches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are several other campsites in the area, including a Camping and Caravanning Club site in
                        West Runton.
                        There are also multiple holiday parks with static caravans. You can walk to some
                        stairs down the cliffs to Cromer beach in about ten minutes, or a further five minutes to the
                        main ramp
                        entryway to the beach by the pier. Alternatively, there's a bus stop right outside the site that
                        goes to
                        Cromer (and on to norwich) in one direction and to Sheringham in the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sheringham is another seaside town about three miles west of Cromer. I would say it's slightly
                        bigger than
                        Cromer and has both a mainline station with connections to norwich (the same train that gets you
                        to Cromer)
                        and a stream train.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can walk on the path beside the road to Sheringham from the campsite in about an hour, which
                        is a fairly
                        pleasant walk with sea views for a lot of the way. Alternatively, you can follow the Norfolk
                        Coast path
                        which can be found right outside the campsite and heads to Sheringham and beyond.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or you could walk down the beach. I did this previously and it was my favourite beach walk I've
                        ever done. I
                        don't know if you can do it at high tide (and since there are huge cliffs and no way off the
                        beach between
                        towns I wouldn't risk it) but at low tide it is an <em>incredibly</em> impressive experience -
                        about three
                        miles just walking on wet compacted sand. And then once you reach Sheringham you can spend some
                        time on the
                        seafront with some fish and chips and then get a bus straight back to the campsite.
