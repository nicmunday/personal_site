                <p>I'm a web designer and programmer from Essex in England.</p>
                <p>I like the outdoors, which mostly manifests itself in as much camping and hiking as possible.</p>
                <p>I'm partially sighted, which mostly manifests itself by falling over a lot and having to be very
                    careful
                    with the hiking thing.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I've designed and built this website to, well, prove that I can design and build a website. It's
                    built in
                    Node.js
                    (as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript, obviously), and you can find out more about it and my
                    other designs by
                    clicking on
                    the web design link in the menu.</p>
